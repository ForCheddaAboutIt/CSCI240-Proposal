I didn't have to do anything to change my tables into 3rd normal form.
This is because for the entity showing, we had a discussion about the number of seats attribute and how it could in theory be related to all of the primary keys. 
Also added Movie ID, Theater ID and Actor ID to their respective tables as the new primary key.
The main changes that are needed is to the ER diagram and that is mainly because I haven't updated it since I created it.
